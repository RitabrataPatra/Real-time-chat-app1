Keep in mind the given "source-code" might not work properly in the upcoming future.
I am saying this because I tried to take help from some websites while making this app and it did not work because they were outdated.

So I had to go socket.io website and had to figure it out all by myself.
And it took me approx. 5 to 6 days to get it working.

So, yeah pls keep this in mind.
